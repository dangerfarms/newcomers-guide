# Code Quality

## Comments
Do not commit commented out code.

We have a repo so that we can go back to older versions simply.

If you need to make inline comments, rethink your code. Maybe there is too much complexity? Name your variables in a way that it is easy to read your code, and you might find that your comment is not necessary after all.
