#Git

Most of our projects are hosted on github.com, so you will need to [create a free account](https://github.com/join) if you have not done so already.

Once you have your github username, please let us know so we can add you to our projects as a collaborator.

##SSH keys
Set up SSH keys on your account, so that you don't have to enter your username and password every time you connect to the github repo. You can follow the guide on the following link: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/.

## Waffle.io
Each of our projects has a Waffle board. Go to https://waffle.io and you will see every board you have access to.

##Workflow
If you are not familiar with the github workflows, please read up on this tutorial: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html

We are currently not using branching for each task, but it is good to understand that as well.

To learn about our workflow, please read [2.2 Workflow](section-2/2-Workflow/README.md).
