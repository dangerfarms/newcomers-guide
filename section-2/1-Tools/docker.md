#Docker

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. More details: https://www.docker.com/what-docker

We use docker in every project, so please install it now.

To set up docker go to: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ and follow the setup steps for your system.

> **Note** Note: this is a test.


**For Linux** make sure that you follow the "Create a Docker group" part after the installation of the docker engine.  
Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group  
Fedora: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/fedora/#create-a-docker-group  
For other distros please find it in the installation page.

**For Mac** you will need to install `docker-machine` as well.

##docker-compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. For more details see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

Please follow the installation instructions on the link above.

##Practice
Please take some time now and look through the docs for `docker` and `docker-compose` to familiarize yourself with these tools.

Feel free to ask any questions.

If you already have access to one of our projects, look at the scripts that interact with docker. You can find them in the root folder and the file names usually start with a `.` (dot).
