# Commitment and Payment

> **Note** Everything in this chapter is subject to change. Please contact us for up to date information.

## Commitment

We require you to commit to a certain number of hours per week. 

The number of hours per week will be agreed upon for each month.

We guarantee to deliver enough tasks for you to fill those hours. In case we fail to deliver, you will get paid for the agreed number of hours.

In case you are assigned to a task, but fail to complete it by the deadline, you will not be paid, or only a part of the original amount will be paid. It is up to the gluers to decide how much will you be paid, in this case.

## Payment

You will be paid at the end of each month after your tasks have been accepted.


For information on the amount of the payment, please contact us.
