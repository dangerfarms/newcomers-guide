# Commitment and Payment

> **Note** Everything in this chapter is subject to change. Please contact us for up to date information.

## Commitment

We require you to commit to a certain number of hours per week. 

The number of hours per week will be agreed upon for each month.

We guarantee to deliver enough tasks for you to fill those hours. In case we fail to deliver, you will get paid for the agreed number of hours.

In case you are assigned to a task, but fail to complete it by the deadline, you will not be paid, or only a part of the original amount will be paid. It is up to the gluers to decide how much will you be paid, in this case.

The estimate for a task which the payment is based upon is determined by the gluers, and assumes that the task is done by an experienced developer.

The price might be modified by a gluer as the complexity of the task unfolds while you are working on it.

## Payment

You will be paid at the end of each month after your tasks have been accepted.
