#Workflow

## Starting a new project

When you start working on a new project, follow the README.md file located in the root directory of the project to set up.

Our projects are in two separate projects in most cases. One is for the backend (or API), the other is for the frontend (or client) code.

If you need help, contact one of us on #slack. 

## Sprints

We organize our workload into Sprints. (Read more about the [Agile development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) on Wikipedia.)


## Working on a task

Our general workflow is as follows:
1. You get assigned to a task (an issue on the github repo, appears as a ticket on the waffle board)
2. As soon as you start reading the specifications, move your task into the "In progress" column on waffle.
3. Once a sub-task (an item with a check-box in the issue description) is complete, commit your work, push. Once pushed, tick the corresponding check-box.
4. Refactor, commit, push.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until task is done.
6. Move your ticket to 'For testing', and either comment on the ticket @mentioning one of the gluers, or let us know you are done on slack.

> **Note** If you are stuck with anything for over 15 minutes, let one of the gluers know on slack.
